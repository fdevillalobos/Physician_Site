# _Physician Review Site_

_Description: Website that classifies all US Physicians by lots of fields to filter them, and lets users add reviews to them. It then shows you physicians reviews and recommendation, prioritizing your social network friends. Because at the time of choosing a Physician, who cares what John in Alabama thinks about him? We want to know what our friends think about them!_
